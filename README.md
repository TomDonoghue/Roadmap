## Open Source Packages

For mature open-source packages, we create dedicated organizations. Each of the projects listed below has it's own organization. 

### FOOOF

I am lead developer of the [FOOOF](https://github.com/fooof-tools/fooof) package, a tool for parameterizing neural power spectra.

[REPO](https://github.com/fooof-tools/fooof) - [DOCS](https://fooof-tools.github.io/fooof/) - [PYPI](https://pypi.org/project/fooof/)

### LISC

I am the lead developer of [LISC](https://github.com/lisc-tools/lisc), or 'Literature Scanner', which is a Python module for collecting and analyzing scientific literature. 

[REPO](https://github.com/lisc-tools/lisc) - [DOCS](https://neurodsp-tools.github.io/neurodsp/) - [PYPI](https://pypi.org/project/lisc/)

### NeuroDSP

I am a co-developer of the [NeuroDSP](https://github.com/neurodsp-tools/neurodsp) package for time-series analysis of neuroscientific data. 

[REPO](https://github.com/neurodsp-tools/neurodsp) - [DOCS](https://neurodsp-tools.github.io/neurodsp/) - [PYPI](https://pypi.org/project/neurodsp/)

## Templates

I maintain and create template structures on the [StructuredScience](https://github.com/StructuredScience/) organization.

### Project Template

A general template for [analysis projects](https://github.com/StructuredScience/ProjectTemplate). 

### EEG Template

A template for [EEG projects](https://github.com/StructuredScience/EEGTemplate).

### Task Template

A template for [behavioural tasks](https://github.com/StructuredScience/TaskTemplate).

## Research Projects

My research projects are mostly hosted on my own [profile](https://github.com/TomDonoghue) and/or on the Voytek lab's [organization](https://github.com/voytekresearch). Projects released through the Voytek lab are also indexed [here](https://github.com/voytekresearch/VoytekLab). 

### ERP-SCANR

The ERP-SCANR project is a project that mines the scientific literature to derive data-driven descriptions and comparisons of event-related potentials (ERPs).

## Teaching Materials

I work on educational materials, including for the organizations Introduction to Python ([COGS18](https://github.com/COGS18)) and Hands-On Data Science ([COGS108](https://github.com/COGS108)).

### Introduction to Programming with Python (COGS18)

I developed and teach an introductory class on programming with Python for cognitive scientists, which is listed as COGS18 in the Department of Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego. 

[Home](https://github.com/COGS18) - [Overview](https://github.com/COGS18/Overview)  - [Materials](https://github.com/COGS18/Materials) - [WebSite](https://cogs18.github.io)

### Hands-On Data Science (COGS108)

I developed materials for a hands-on data science class, which is listed as COGS 108 in the Department of Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego. This course was created by Professor Bradley Voytek. 

[Home](https://github.com/COGS108) - [Overview](https://github.com/COGS108/Overview)  - [Materials](https://github.com/COGS108/Tutorials)

### Introduction to Cognitive Science

A [collection](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/CogSciClass) of materials and links for teaching an introduction to cognitive science. 

### Python Bootcamp

A [notebook](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/PythonBootcamp) with an overview of using / getting started with using Python for grad school, and some general programming tips. 

## Collections

I maintain and collect lists of openly available materials on the [OpenLists](https://github.com/OpenLists/) organization.

### OpenData

A [collection](https://github.com/OpenLists/OpenData) of open data in (mostly human) electrophysiology (EEG/MEG/ECoG).

### OpenTools

A [collection](https://github.com/OpenLists/OpenTools) of open tools for (mostly human) electrophysiology (EEG/MEG/ECoG).

### Neuro History

A [collection](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/NeuroHistory) of old papers in neuroscience.
