# Roadmap

A quick map of my code and any thing else of mine that found it's way onto Github. 

## Neuroscience Research

### FOOOF

As part of the Voytek Lab I am lead developed of the [fooof](https://github.com/voytekresearch/fooof) package, a tool for parameterizing neural power spectra. 

### ERP-SCANR

A [repository](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/ERP_SCANR) for the ERP-SCANR project, mining the existing literature to derive data-driven descriptions and comparisons of event-related potentials (ERPs). Project site [here](http://tomdonoghue.github.io/ERP_SCANR/)

Note: for doing literature scanning, this codebase has been updated and generalized into a module called 'lisc' (Literature Scanner), that is currently available on the NeuroHackWeek organization [here](https://github.com/neurohackweek/DataDrivenCognitiveOntology). Also available there is some work (with a group at neurohackweek) working on a 'Data Driven Cognitive Ontology'.

### Psychopy Templates

To organize and systematize our behvioural experiments, including experiments run with EEG, and online BCI components, I have developed some [psychopy templates](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/psychopy_templates), that are openly available.

### neurodsp

As part of the Voytek Lab I am a contributor to the [neurodsp](https://github.com/voytekresearch/neurodsp) package, for time-series analysis of neuroscientific data. 

## Programming Materials & Tutorials

### Python Bootcamp

A [notebook](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/PythonBootcamp) with an overview of using / getting started with using Python for grad school, and some general programming tips. 

### Hands-On Data Science

I developed a lot of materials for a hands-on data science class (COGS 108 @ UCSD, with Professor Bradley Voytek), all of which are available [here](https://github.com/COGS108), and in particular the hands-on tutorials are available [here](https://github.com/COGS108/SectionMaterials). 

## Collections

### Neuro History

A [collection](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/NeuroHistory) of old papers in neuroscience.

### CogSciClass

A [collection](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/CogSciClass) of materials and links for teaching cognitive science.
