# Roadmap

A quick map of my code and any thing else of mine that found it's way onto Github. Broadly, all contributions are either my [profile](https://github.com/TomDonoghue), on the Voytek lab's [organization](https://github.com/voytekresearch), or on one of the class organizations I work on, Introduction to Python ([COGS18](https://github.com/COGS18)) or Hands-On Data Science ([COGS108](https://github.com/COGS108)).

## Python Modules

### FOOOF

As part of the Voytek Lab I am lead developed of the [fooof](https://github.com/voytekresearch/fooof) package, a tool for parameterizing neural power spectra. FOOOF is available on [PYPI](https://pypi.org/project/fooof/).

### LISC

[LIterature SCanner](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/lisc) is a Python module for collecting and meta-analyzing scientific literature, built on top of the Pubmed E-Utils API. 

### neurodsp

As part of the Voytek Lab I am a contributor to the [neurodsp](https://github.com/voytekresearch/neurodsp) package, for time-series analysis of neuroscientific data. Neurodsp is available on [PYPI](https://pypi.org/project/neurodsp/).

## Neuroscience Research (Projects)

### ERP-SCANR

A [repository](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/ERP_SCANR) for the ERP-SCANR project, mining the existing literature to derive data-driven descriptions and comparisons of event-related potentials (ERPs). Project site [here](http://tomdonoghue.github.io/ERP_SCANR/)

### Psychopy Templates

To organize and systematize our behvioural experiments, including experiments run with EEG, and online BCI components, I have developed some [psychopy templates](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/psychopy_templates), that are openly available.

## Teaching Materials & Tutorials

### Introduction to Programming with Python (COGS18)

I teach an introductory class on programming with Python (COGS18 @ UCSD). All of the materials for this class are available in the class [Github Organization](https://github.com/COGS18), including the [overview](https://github.com/COGS18/Overview) and [tutorials](https://github.com/COGS18/Tutorials). 

### Hands-On Data Science (COGS108)

I developed a lot of materials for a hands-on data science class (COGS 108 @ UCSD, with Professor Bradley Voytek), all of which are available [here](https://github.com/COGS108), and in particular the hands-on tutorials are available [here](https://github.com/COGS108/SectionMaterials). 

### Introduction to Cognitive Science

A [collection](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/CogSciClass) of materials and links for teaching an introduction to cognitive science. 

### Python Bootcamp

A [notebook](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/PythonBootcamp) with an overview of using / getting started with using Python for grad school, and some general programming tips. 

## Collections

### OpenData

A [collection](https://github.com/voytekresearch/OpenData) of open data in (mostly human) electrophysiology (EEG/MEG/ECoG).

### OpenTools

A [collection](https://github.com/voytekresearch/OpenTools) of open tools for (mostly human) electrophysiology (EEG/MEG/ECoG).

### Neuro History

A [collection](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/NeuroHistory) of old papers in neuroscience.
