## Open Source Packages

I develop and maintain open-source Python packages.
Each of the projects listed below has it's own organization. 

### FOOOF

I am lead developer of the [FOOOF](https://github.com/fooof-tools/fooof) package, a tool for parameterizing neural power spectra.

[REPO](https://github.com/fooof-tools/fooof) - [DOCS](https://fooof-tools.github.io/fooof/) - [PYPI](https://pypi.org/project/fooof/)

### LISC

I am the lead developer of [LISC](https://github.com/lisc-tools/lisc), or 'Literature Scanner', which is a Python module for collecting and analyzing scientific literature. 

[REPO](https://github.com/lisc-tools/lisc) - 
[DOCS](https://neurodsp-tools.github.io/neurodsp/) - 
[PYPI](https://pypi.org/project/lisc/)

### NeuroDSP

I am a co-developer of the [NeuroDSP](https://github.com/neurodsp-tools/neurodsp) package for time-series analysis of neuroscientific data. 

[REPO](https://github.com/neurodsp-tools/neurodsp) - 
[DOCS](https://neurodsp-tools.github.io/neurodsp/) - 
[PYPI](https://pypi.org/project/neurodsp/)

## Templates and Resources

I create and maintain templates for projects on the 
[StructuredScience](https://github.com/StructuredScience/) organization. 

An overview of all the templates is [here](https://github.com/structuredscience/Overview).

I also create and curate lists of open resources, collected together on the
[OpenLists](https://github.com/openlists) organization.

An overview of all the lists is [here](https://github.com/openlists/Overview).

## Research Projects

My research projects are mostly hosted on my own 
[profile](https://github.com/TomDonoghue) and/or on the Voytek lab's 
[organization](https://github.com/voytekresearch). 

Projects released through the Voytek lab are also indexed 
[here](https://github.com/voytekresearch/VoytekLab). 

### Band Ratios

The BandRatios project explores properties of band ratio measures in electrophysiological data, and compares them to spectral features.

Work with: Julio Dominguez & Bradley Voytek

[Preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.11.900977v1)

### ERP-SCANR

The ERP-SCANR project is a project that mines the scientific literature to derive data-driven descriptions and comparisons of event-related potentials (ERPs).

Work with: Bradley Voytek

[Repository](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/ERP_SCANR) - 
[WebSite](http://tomdonoghue.github.io/ERP_SCANR/)

### Parameterizing Neural Power Spectra

The Parameterizing Neural Power Spectra project explores a proposed method for measuring periodic and aperiodic activity in neural power spectra, and demonstrates a series of applications of the method. 

Work with: Bradley Voytek

[Repository](https://github.com/fooof-tools/Paper) - 
[Preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/299859v1)

## Teaching Materials

I work on educational materials, including for the organizations Introduction to Python 
([COGS18](https://github.com/COGS18)) and Hands-On Data Science 
([COGS108](https://github.com/COGS108)).

### Introduction to Programming with Python (COGS18)

I developed and teach an introductory class on programming with Python for cognitive scientists, which is listed as COGS18 in the Department of Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego.

### Hands-On Data Science (COGS108)

I developed materials for a hands-on data science class, which is listed as COGS 108 in the Department of Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego. This course was created by Professor Bradley Voytek.

### Introduction to Cognitive Science

A [collection](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/CogSciClass) of materials and links for teaching an introduction to cognitive science. 

### Python Bootcamp

A [notebook](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/PythonBootcamp) with an overview of using / getting started with using Python for grad school, and some general programming tips.
