# Roadmap

A quick map of code and any things that have found their way onto Github. 

Broadly, all contributions are either my [profile](https://github.com/TomDonoghue), on the Voytek lab's [organization](https://github.com/voytekresearch), or on one of the class organizations I work on, Introduction to Python ([COGS18](https://github.com/COGS18)) or Hands-On Data Science ([COGS108](https://github.com/COGS108)).

## Open Source Packages

#### FOOOF

As part of the Voytek Lab I am lead developed of the [fooof](https://github.com/fooof-tools/fooof) package, a tool for parameterizing neural power spectra. FOOOF is available on [PYPI](https://pypi.org/project/fooof/).

#### LISC

[LIterature SCanner](https://github.com/lisc-tools/lisc) is a Python module for collecting and meta-analyzing scientific literature, built on top of the Pubmed E-Utils API. 

#### NeuroDSP

As part of the Voytek Lab I am a contributor to the [neurodsp](https://github.com/neurodsp-tools/neurodsp) package, for time-series analysis of neuroscientific data. Neurodsp is available on [PYPI](https://pypi.org/project/neurodsp/).

## Templates

#### Project Template

A general template for [analysis projects](https://github.com/StructuredScience/ProjectTemplate). 

#### Task Template

A template for [behavioural tasks](https://github.com/StructuredScience/TaskTemplate).

#### EEG Template

A template for [EEG projects](https://github.com/StructuredScience/EEGTemplate).

## Research Projects

#### ERP-SCANR

A [repository](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/ERP_SCANR) for the ERP-SCANR project, mining the existing literature to derive data-driven descriptions and comparisons of event-related potentials (ERPs). Project site [here](http://tomdonoghue.github.io/ERP_SCANR/)

## Teaching Materials

#### Introduction to Programming with Python (COGS18)

I teach an introductory class on programming with Python (COGS18 @ UCSD). All of the materials for this class are available in the class [Github Organization](https://github.com/COGS18), including the [overview](https://github.com/COGS18/Overview) and [course materials](https://github.com/COGS18/Materials). This class is also hosted on the course [website](https://cogs18.github.io). 

#### Hands-On Data Science (COGS108)

I developed a lot of materials for a hands-on data science class (COGS 108 @ UCSD, with Professor Bradley Voytek), all of which are available [here](https://github.com/COGS108), and in particular the hands-on tutorials are available [here](https://github.com/COGS108/Tutorials). 

#### Introduction to Cognitive Science

A [collection](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/CogSciClass) of materials and links for teaching an introduction to cognitive science. 

#### Python Bootcamp

A [notebook](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/PythonBootcamp) with an overview of using / getting started with using Python for grad school, and some general programming tips. 

## Collections

#### OpenData

A [collection](https://github.com/OpenLists/OpenData) of open data in (mostly human) electrophysiology (EEG/MEG/ECoG).

#### OpenTools

A [collection](https://github.com/OpenLists/OpenTools) of open tools for (mostly human) electrophysiology (EEG/MEG/ECoG).

#### Neuro History

A [collection](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/NeuroHistory) of old papers in neuroscience.
